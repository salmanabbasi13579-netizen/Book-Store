 # Project Description

Bound & Found is a responsive online book store web application designed to help readers browse, explore, and order books. It provides an engaging user interface where users can view featured titles, explore categories, and learn about the stores offerings. The site is built using modern web technologies and is deployed as a static web project that runs in the browser.

The homepage introduces the concept of the store with sections such as bestselling books, book categories, and customer reviews. Users can navigate to different parts of the application using the navigation bar, including options to browse the collection, place orders, and learn more about the stores mission and services. The design emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and an intuitive browsing experience for all users.
